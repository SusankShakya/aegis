[![License: MIT OR Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT%20OR%20Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A secure, cross-platform agent framework designed to provide a robust foundation for building distributed applications, services, and agent-based systems.

## Overview

Aegis provides a unified framework for developing applications that can run seamlessly across multiple platforms while maintaining security, reliability, and performance. It abstracts away platform-specific details, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than platform intricacies.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and more
- **Security-First Design**: Built-in encryption, secure communication, and authentication
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design with pluggable components
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with context
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent logging across all components
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration system with validation
- **Process Management**: Launch, monitor, and control child processes

## Project Structure

The Aegis framework is organized into the following crates:

- **aegis**: Main framework umbrella crate
- **aegis-core**: Platform-agnostic core functionality
- **aegis-platform-***: Platform-specific implementations
- **aegis-net**: Networking and communication
- **aegis-agent**: Agent framework and management
- **aegis-crypto**: Cryptography and security utilities

## Getting Started

Add Aegis to your project:

```toml
[dependencies]
aegis = "0.1.0"
```

Basic example:

```rust
use aegis::prelude::*;

fn main() -> AegisResult<()> {
    // Initialize the framework
    let config = AegisConfig::default();
    aegis::init(Some(&config))?;
    
    // Your application code here...
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Development Status

Aegis is currently in early development. The API is unstable and subject to change.
